## My Process

### Built With

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I Learned

Throughout this project, I learned several key concepts, including:

- **Responsive Design:** Utilizing media queries to adapt layouts based on screen sizes.
- **CSS Grid and Flexbox:** Applying these technologies to create structured and responsive layouts.

Here are some code snippets I'm particularly proud of:

```html
<h1>Some HTML code I'm proud of</h1>
```
```css
.proud-of-this-css {
  color: papayawhip;
}
```
```js
const proudOfThisFunc = () => {
  console.log('ðŸŽ‰');
}
```

### Continued Development

In future projects, I aim to focus on:

- Enhancing my understanding of accessibility in web design.
- Refining my skills with CSS preprocessors like Sass.
- Exploring more advanced features of React and Next.js.
